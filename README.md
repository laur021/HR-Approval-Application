HR Approval Application
The HR Approval Application is designed to streamline the process of managing and approving requests related to employee attendance and scheduling. This application focuses on the approval, rejection, and summary display of various employee requests, including:

Leave requests
Change shift requests
Overtime approvals
Timekeeping infractions
Late records

Key Features:
Approval/Rejection Process: Managers can quickly approve or reject requests based on available information.
Summary Views: Comprehensive summaries for each type of request, allowing for quick overviews of pending, approved, or rejected entries.
Data Insights: View overall trends and data summaries for informed decision-making.

Important Note:
This application handles only the approval, rejection, and summary of requests. The actual submission of requests (leave, change shift, overtime, and late) occurs in a separate system. The HR Approval Application integrates with that system to manage the final decisions.
